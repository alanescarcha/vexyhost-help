# ‚ùì FAQ

## What are your support hours?

Our support team responds every day at any time whenever possible. Please note that holidays, weekends and public holidays may cause delays in response.

## Are your servers up 24/7?

Yes, of course. Our servers never sleep or take breaks, when maintenance work is performed, notifications are sent to affected services days in advance.

## How long does activation take?

It is instantaneous. Our automated system will automatically activate your server immediately upon completion of your order. Remember that dedicated servers require manual setup and may take a little longer, as we rely on on-site personnel.

## Do you offer DDoS protection?

Of course, all our services have protection against this kind of attacks, some locations have better Anti-DDoS filters for specific games, so you can consult us in case your server is a constant target of attacks.

## Can I upgrade/downgrade my server later without losing my data/IP/etc.?

Yes, of course. We have a system that allows you to upgrade or downgrade your server at any time. It is a fully automated self-service system that you can access from the client area. When upgrading, you will only have to pay the prorated amount (the difference between your current plan and the one chosen based on the remaining days of service).

## How much storage do I have available on my Game Server?

Storage on most games is unlimited. You can use as much space as you need for your server as long as you comply with our fair usage policy. Essentially - you can use as much space as you need for your service as long as it is related to your service (you cannot store movies, music, etc.). To find out if your service has limited storage, you can check the product page among its features.

## What is your refund policy?

We offer a 7-day money-back guarantee. If for any reason you are not satisfied with your purchase or have simply changed your mind, please contact us for a full or partial refund depending on the situation, all we ask is that you let us know why you want to refund so we can improve our service for the future.
