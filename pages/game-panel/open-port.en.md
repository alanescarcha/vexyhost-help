# How to create ports

You can open a port by going to the Network section. Here you can open a random port for your server by clicking on the `Create Allocation` button.

`Make Primary` means that the new port will be used as the primary port to access your server, we do not recommend modifying this.

## Why random port?

In most cases, a fixed port number is not necessary, as the port number can be changed in the settings. Minecraft plugins, for example, always have a configuration where the port number can be set.

If you do not have a dedicated IP, more than one client will be on the same IP and specifying the port to open, could generate availability problems.

If you have a dedicated IP and want a specific port, you can open a support ticket and we will give you the specific port you need.
