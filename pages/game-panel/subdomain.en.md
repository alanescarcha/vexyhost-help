# Set up a Subdomain

Our gaming panel allows you to set up a custom subdomain for your server. To create a subdomain, go to the Subdomains section, type in the subdomain prefix and then the domain you want to use. We have a few options in the drop down menu for you to choose from.

You can then use the selected subdomain to connect to your server. Note that some games do not support subdomains or SRV records, for those games that support subdomains but not an SRV record, you will need a dedicated IP.
