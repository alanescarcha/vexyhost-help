# Add another user to your server

If you want another person to be able to administer your server, you can add them in the users section. Go to Users section and then click on the `New User` button, a form like the one below will appear:

First, enter the email address of the person you want to add. Then select the permissions you would like that person to have on your server. Once you have finished configuring all the permissions, click on the `Invite User` button.

If the person you are adding already has an account with us in our game panel, they will now see the server in their server list. Otherwise, that person will receive an email with information on how to set up their account for the game panel.
