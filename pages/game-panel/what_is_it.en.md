# What panel is the Game Panel?

We call Game Panel our main control panel [https://panel.vexyhost.com/](https://panel.vexyhost.com/) which is used for most of the games we offer, and besides games, it is also used for some software services like AI agents, database, Discord bots.

## Why do some services use this panel and others don't?

The main feature of our Game Panel is that it allows to use Docker images, which allows creating containers or instances, to run applications, games and services inside in an isolated and secure way, but this has a limitation in services where it is necessary to interact with the operating system. Therefore, not all the services we offer should be used with Docker.

For example, web hosting services should be used with cPanel, since it is a panel dedicated to web hosting and website management, and VPS hosting should be used with Virtualizor, which is a panel dedicated to the creation and management of VPS. These panels are more suitable for these specific services, and most of these control panels allow us to have greater internal control of the infrastructure, from the location to manage large amounts of services in a simple and effective way.
