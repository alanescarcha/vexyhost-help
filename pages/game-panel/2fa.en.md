# Set up 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)

2FA adds an additional layer of security to your account that is very important. Adding 2FA to your account means that someone would need both your password and a login code that changes every 60 seconds.

To set up 2FA in your game panel account, you will need to go to the [Account](https://panel.vexyhost.com/account) section and under `Configure Two Factor` follow the steps below. You will need to download an authentication app for your phone (we recommend Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator) and scan the QR code.

Be sure to save the backup codes physically, such as on a piece of paper and in a safe place.
