# Moving files and folders

If you've uploaded your files to the wrong place you can move them by right-clicking then pressing `Move`. Here you can enter the location you want to move the files.

If you want to move the files backwards you can use `../` at the beginning. If you want to move back more than once, you can do `../../` this will move 2 folders back.

Below you can see the final path where the file or folder will be moved to.
