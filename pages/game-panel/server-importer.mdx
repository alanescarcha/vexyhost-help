# Server Importer Tool

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Please note that the import tool may not work correctly with all hosting providers because some of them have limitations on the FTP or SFTP protocol to prevent attacks.
    **If this is your case, open a ticket and our support team will help you migrate your files to VexyHost, we can do it for you.**
</Callout>

If you are coming from another host, you can use our server import tool to download all your files. To do this, your old host must have **FTP** or **SFTP** access enabled. If this is not the case, please contact our support team so that we can migrate the files manually.

To use the import tool, go to the `Settings` section and then click on `Import Server` under the `SERVER IMPORTER` box.

Then select the import type, enter your old host information. Be sure to check first if your old host uses FTP or SFTP, if you are not sure, contact our support team.

You can also choose the source folder of your old host and the destination folder of the VexyHost server, and you can choose whether you want to delete all files from the VexyHost server before starting the migration.

The server will then start importing. Please note that, depending on the size of your files or the location of the old host, this could take up to an hour. **If the process takes longer than an hour, please contact our support team to check the status of the migration.**
