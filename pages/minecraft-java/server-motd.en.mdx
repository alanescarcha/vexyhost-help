# How to set MOTD to your Minecraft server

import { Steps, Code } from 'nextra/components';

<Steps>

### Step 1

We go to a web site that allows us to create our server description in a simple way, we recommend pages like these:

- https://motd.gg
- https://mctools.org/motd-creator

### Step 2

In our case we are going to use motd.gg, there we create our motd, you can also copy the motd from any server using the "Grab from server" button.

### Step 3

Finally when we finish creating our motd we use the "Get your MOTD" button and copy it to our server's <Code>server.properties</Code> file (Remember to have the "Escape" option checked in motd.gg).
