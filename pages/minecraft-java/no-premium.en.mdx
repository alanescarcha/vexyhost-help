# How to change the server to Non-Premium

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components';

<Steps>

### Step 1

We stop our server and in the `server.properties` file we change the `online-mode` parameter to `false`.

```properties filename="server.properties" copy=true
online-mode=false
```

### Step 2
Start your server and now players will be able to join without having a premium or paid account.
