# How to set your server icon

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components';

<Steps>

### Step 1

First you need to have the image that you are going to use as an icon on your server, this image must be in **PNG format** and must have a size of **64x64 pixels**, otherwise the icon will not load on the server.

### Step 2

After we have our image in .png format and size 64x64 pixels, you must rename the file to: `server-icon.png` and upload it to the server. You can upload the `server-icon.png` file by dragging and dropping it from the File Manager in the Game Panel.

### Step 3
Restart your server and you should now be able to see your server icon in the game.
