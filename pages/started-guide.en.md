This guide is intended to help you and answer common questions about our services.

## How do I find my service information, such as IP address and panel logins?

Your service information will be emailed to you once it has been set up. Look for emails with the following subjects based on what you have requested:

**Game Hosting:** Your server has been activated

**Web Hosting:** Your Web Hosting has been activated

**VPS Hosting:** Your VPS has been created

## I checked my email and I don't see my server information. What do I do?

Sometimes our email may be in your junk/spam folder. Be sure to check them to make sure it is not there. We also recommend that you add our address support@vexyhost.com to your safe senders list to ensure that none of our emails are marked as spam by accident.

## I checked my email and folders but still can't find my server information

It could get lost in your junk mail. However, you can get copies of all your emails sent to you in the billing panel here: [https://billing.vexyhost.com/clientarea.php?action=emails](https://billing.vexyhost.com/clientarea.php?action=emails)

There you will see copies of all emails that we have sent you. Otherwise, you can contact us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wSynTxthSR), [Support Ticket](https://vexyhost.com/support) or send an email to support@vexyhost.com.
