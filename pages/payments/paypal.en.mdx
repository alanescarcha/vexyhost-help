### Step 1 - Find the invoice
Go to [your invoices](https://billing.vexyhost.com/clientarea.php?action=invoices). Find the invoice you want to pay and click on the invoice.

### Step 2 - Select payment method
There, you should choose whether to pay with a **Subscription** or make a **One-time Payment**.

<Callout type="info">
- The **Subscription** option means that you will automatically pay every month or for the number of months you selected in the Billing Cycle of that invoice, which can be Monthly, Quarterly, Semi-Annually, or Annually. You can cancel the subscription at any time. To learn how to cancel your PayPal subscription, you can check [here](/billing-faq/cancel-paypal).
- **One-time Payment** means that you will pay only once. **Please remember to keep your payments up to date before the due date to avoid service suspension due to non-payment.**
