    We recommend using **strong passwords, at least 12 characters long, containing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and at least one symbol**. Avoid using common text strings and words in any language, proper names, places, phone numbers, consecutive numbers (like 123456), consecutive keys on a keyboard (like 'qwerty'), birth dates, as well as excessively short combinations (like "Juan1997") or dictionary words, as they are highly vulnerable and easy to decipher.
