## If your service is suspended it is for a reason such as:

### You forgot to pay your invoices

You forgot to pay your invoices and your server was suspended automatically. Once this happens, you will have 7 days to pay the invoices until it says terminated. **You will not be able to recover your files once the server has been terminated**.

### You have breached our terms of service

Your service will be suspended if you have breached our terms of service. You can read more by clicking [here](https://vexyhost.com/terms/). However, if this happens, you will receive a notification via a ticket and email. Most of the time you may receive a notification before any action is taken against your service or server.

### Your service is at risk

If we detect any anomaly in your service/server we will suspend it immediately and proceed to notify you through a ticket and email.
