# Reverse DNS / PTR Record

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout>
Email servers use PTR records to verify the authenticity of sending IP addresses. PTR records can help prevent emails from being labeled as spam or rejected by other mail servers such as Gmail. **Remember that you must also maintain a good reputation of the IP of the VPS, if you send SPAM, nothing can help you, plus we can get to suspend your VPS for this reason.**

At the moment it is not possible to change the reverse DNS and PTR record of your VPS IPs from the VPS panel. You must request the change by support ticket, this is completely free. **Remember to specify the IP to change and the new hostname.**
