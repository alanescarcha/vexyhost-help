# How to Login

After ordering your server, you should have received a few emails. Some will have been from our billing system confirming the order, another should be from the VPS panel. Please note that you will only receive the email from the VPS once your payment has been successfully validated and processed (check your spam folder).

Once you have received the email from the VPS confirming the server creation (email subject: **Your VPS has been created**), you can go to https://vps.vexyhost.com/ and login with your email and password.

If for some reason you forget your VPS panel password. You can reset your password from here: https://vps.vexyhost.com/#act=login&sa=fpass
