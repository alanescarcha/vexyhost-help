Renewing your services is easy and straightforward. You don't need to generate a new order.

<Callout>
    A notification is always sent 7 days before the service expiration date, and all services are automatically suspended 1 day after the expiration date. **After the service suspension, you have 7 days to pay for the renewal**, otherwise, on the 7th day, your service will be terminated, risking the loss of all information and configurations. **You will be notified by email before suspending your service, and reminders will be sent days before the expiration date.**
</Callout>

### Step 1 - Choose service
To view your active services and those about to expire, go to the [billing panel](https://billing.vexyhost.com/clientarea.php).

You will see your active services, and those that are about to expire will be marked with a red exclamation mark, indicating that the service will expire soon.

### Step 2 - Pay invoice

A notification is always sent 7 days before the expiration date, and the invoice is automatically generated to renew the service. In the [unpaid invoices section](https://billing.vexyhost.com/clientarea.php?action=invoices) of the billing panel, you can click and review all the invoices. Make sure to pay the invoice corresponding to the service you want to renew.
