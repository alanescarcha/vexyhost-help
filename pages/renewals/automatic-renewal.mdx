# ðŸ’² Automatic Renewal

## ðŸ’¸ PayPal

The only way to automatically renew your services using PayPal is by paying the invoice using the recurring payment or subscription method, which we explained [here](/payments/paypal#step-2---select-payment-method).

To cancel a PayPal subscription, you need to follow the steps outlined [here](/billing-faq/cancel-paypal).

## ðŸ’° Credit Balance

If you have a Credit Balance on your account, your services will be automatically renewed to ensure they are up to date and to avoid suspension. Therefore, if you have sufficient balance on the service's due date with automatic renewal enabled, it will be renewed as soon as the invoice is generated.

If you want to renew your service before the due date and use your Credit Balance, click [here](/payments/credit-balance) to learn how.
