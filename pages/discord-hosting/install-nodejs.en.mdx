### Step 5
Upload your bot files and start the server. If your bot needs settings like environment variables you can create the .env file and place your environment variables there.

By default a simple example code is downloaded from the GitHub repository https://github.com/vexyhost/discord-js-bot you can delete those files to upload your bot.
By default the file that will try to start the server is index.js you can change this from the Startup tab.
