# How to change Palworld server settings

import { Callout, Steps, Code } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info">
    This game is in Early Access, so changing settings can be confusing at first. Some parameters such as **ServerPlayerMaxNum**, **ServerName**, **ServerPassword** and **AdminPassword** are configured from the Startup tab.

## Known Issues / FAQ
1. The server won't show up in the Community-Server tab.<br/>
-> This is a known problem and the devs will hopefully fix that asap. Best choice is to connect by IP and Password.
2. The server has a memory leak.<br/>
-> This is also an issue that they are aware of.<br/>
-> The bEnableInvaderEnemy option seems to have a huge impact on the current RAM usage. Disabling it might be choice.<br/>
-> Tip: Schedule a server restart every 6h. You might adjust the value according to your RAM!
3. The server does not show up in the steam server list.<br/>
-> This is might never be supported.
4. The config file gets deleted/reset on server restart.<br/>
-> If your server ports is different than the default port (8211) you need to adjust the port inside the config file <Code>Pal/Saved/Config/LinuxServer/PalWorldSettings.ini</Code>.<br/>
-> Before editing the config file always make sure to fully stop the server first. Otherwise all changes wont be saved.

### Step 5

Now you can edit the parameters and settings you need, **remember to save the file using the blue button that says "Save content".**

    When you start and stop the server the content of the PalWorldSettings.ini file is deleted, we recommend to save this somewhere on your PC to remember the parameters or settings you made.
