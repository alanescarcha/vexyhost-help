    For Discord bots, we use the same [Game Panel](https://panel.vexyhost.com) used for Game Hosting services. This is because the Pterodactyl Panel we use is compatible with it and allows us to create Eggs/Images with open-source bot code.

<Steps>

### Step 1 - Choose plan
Go to [Discord Bot Hosting plans](https://vexyhost.com/discord-hosting/). Choose the plan that best suits your needs. If you're unsure which one to choose, you can contact support for assistance.

### Step 2 - Choose billing cycle
Next, you'll need to choose the billing cycle. You can choose to pay for your service monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. **The longer the period you choose, the more discount you'll receive.**

| Cycle | Months |
| ------ | ------ |
| Monthly | Every month |
| Quarterly | Every 3 months |
| Semi-Annual | Every 6 months |
| Annual | Every 12 months |

<Callout type="info">
    The **Standard** plan, due to its low monthly cost, can only be paid for quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. This is because the monthly cost of this plan is very low and it does not make sense to charge such a small amount per month without losing it in commissions for payment methods.

### Step 3 - Server Location
In the "Location" section, you can choose the location of your server. Most of the time, the displayed locations have available stock. However, it's possible that a location may not have stock at that moment, and your server will be created in a nearby location.

### Step 4 - Bot Software
In the "Bot Language or Software" section, you can select the language of your bot or project. The parentheses indicate the programming language used for the bot. **discord.js** and **discord.py** are generic bots with example code. The idea is for you to upload your own bot or one that you have purchased and select whether it runs on Node.js or Python. We also have open source bots ready to install with a single click.

    In the [Game Panel](https://panel.vexyhost.com), you can later choose the language of your bot or another pre-existing project like JMusicBot, Red Bot, or Discord Tickets if you want to switch to a different bot. This can be done through the Discord Bot Installer.

### Step 5 - Backups
In the "Backups" section, you can choose the option to have more than 1 backup of your server. Unlike other hosting providers, we believe that everyone should have the ability to make at least 1 backup of their server for free, as backups are important for data protection. These backups can be generated and restored from the [Game Panel](https://panel.vexyhost.com), and you can also download the backup to your device if you want to store it locally.

<Callout type="info">
    In addition to the backups mentioned above, which are managed from the [Game Panel](https://panel.vexyhost.com), we also perform external backups of all servers and nodes every 24 hours, every 7 days and every month. These backups include both files and databases. If you need one of these backups, you can contact us via support ticket.
</Callout>

### Step 6 - Server Name
Finally, you can choose the name for your server. This name will appear in the [Game Panel](https://panel.vexyhost.com).

<Callout type="info">
    Plans offer additional services such as "Server migration," where we handle migrating your server or Discord bot from another hosting provider to ours. If you choose this add-on, you should open a support ticket after the purchase.

### Step 7 - Review & Payment
ðŸ‘€ Review the summary of your purchase and click on the Continue button. On the summary page, you can enter a discount code if you have one and choose the payment method. Once you complete the summary page, the order will be generated, and you will be redirected to the payment gateway according to the chosen payment method.

</Steps>

**âœ” Great! Now you can proceed with the payment. If you have any questions about paying your invoices, you can check our tutorial [here](/payments-country).** Once we receive the payment, we will send you an email confirming the activation of your services.
