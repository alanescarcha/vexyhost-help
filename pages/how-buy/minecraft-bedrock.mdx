<Steps>

### Step 1 - Choose plan
Go to [Mineacraft Bedrock plans](https://billing.vexyhost.com/store/minecraft-bedrock). Choose the plan that best suits your needs. If you're unsure which one to choose, you can contact support for assistance.

### Step 2 - Choose billing cycle
Next, you'll need to choose the billing cycle. You can choose to pay for your service monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. **The longer the period you choose, the more discount you'll receive.**

| Cycle | Months |
| ------ | ------ |
| Monthly | Every month |
| Quarterly | Every 3 months |
| Semi-Annual | Every 6 months |
| Annual | Every 12 months |

### Step 3 - Server Location
In the "Location" section, you can choose the location of your server. Most of the time, the displayed locations have available stock. However, it's possible that a location may not have stock at that moment, and your server will be created in a nearby location.

### Step 4 - Dedicated IP
In the "Dedicated IP" section, you can select whether you want to have a Dedicated IP with port 19132 available only for your server.

<Callout type="info">
The Dedicated IP is usually used to set up a domain without specifying the port in the game, as the default port for Minecraft Bedrock is 19132. In the [Game Panel](https://panel.vexyhost.com), you can add more ports to your server for free if needed.

### Step 5 - Version
Then, in the "Version" section, you can select the version of your Minecraft Bedrock server.

<Callout type="info">
When you create your server, it will always download the latest available version of Minecraft. However, in the [Game Panel](https://panel.vexyhost.com), you can choose specific versions if you don't want the latest one using the Versions Installer.

Please note that each version may require more or less RAM to run. You can check the versions available in our Versions Installer and the recommended RAM for each version at https://jars.vexyhost.com (select the Bedrock tab) if you haven't purchased your server yet. If you already have a server, you can do it all from the Versions Installer in the panel.

### Step 6 - Backups
In the "Backups" section, you can choose the option to have more than 1 backup of your server. Unlike other hosting providers, we believe that everyone should have the ability to make at least 1 backup of their server for free, as backups are important for data protection. These backups can be generated and restored from the [Game Panel](https://panel.vexyhost.com), and you can also download the backup to your device if you want to store it locally.

<Callout type="info">
    In addition to the backups mentioned above, which are managed from the [Game Panel](https://panel.vexyhost.com), we also perform external backups of all servers and nodes every 24 hours, every 7 days and every month. These backups include both files and databases. If you need one of these backups, you can contact us via support ticket.
</Callout>

### Step 7 - Server Name
Finally, you can choose the name for your server. This name will appear in the [Game Panel](https://panel.vexyhost.com), NOT in the in-game server name.

<Callout type="info">
    Plans offer additional services such as "Server migration," where we handle migrating your server or Discord bot from another hosting provider to ours. If you choose this add-on, you should open a support ticket after the purchase.

### Step 8 - Review & Payment
ðŸ‘€ Review the summary of your purchase and click on the Continue button. On the summary page, you can enter a discount code if you have one and choose the payment method. Once you complete the summary page, the order will be generated, and you will be redirected to the payment gateway according to the chosen payment method.

</Steps>

**âœ” Great! Now you can proceed with the payment. If you have any questions about paying your invoices, you can check our tutorial [here](/account-billing/category/-how-to-pay-according-to-your-country).** Once we receive the payment, we will send you an email confirming the activation of your services.
