<Steps>

### Step 1 - Choose plan
Go to [Web Hosting plans](https://billing.vexyhost.com/store/web-hosting). Choose the plan that best suits your needs. If you're unsure which one to choose, you can contact support for assistance.

### Step 2 - Choose your domain
When you select a plan, you'll need to indicate whether you want to use an existing domain that you have already purchased from another domain provider or use a subdomain from VexyHost.

    If you don't have a domain yet and you're looking for a place to register it, we recommend registering it at [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/domain-name-search/). It's really affordable, and they have no limitations with NameServers or DNS Servers like other domain providers. If you're in Argentina and want to register a `.com.ar` or `.ar` domain, you should register your domain at [NIC.AR](https://nic.ar/buscar-dominio).

### Step 3 - Choose billing cycle
Next, you'll need to choose the billing cycle. You can choose to pay for your service monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. **The longer the period you choose, the more discount you'll receive.**

| Cycle | Months |
| ------ | ------ |
| Monthly | Every month |
| Quarterly | Every 3 months |
| Semi-Annual | Every 6 months |
| Annual | Every 12 months |

Some plans have the option to choose additional services like "Website migration," where we take care of migrating your website, including databases, files, and emails, to our hosting. Remember to open a ticket after the purchase, as these processes are done manually.

### Step 4 - Review & Payment
ðŸ‘€ Finally, review the summary of your purchase and click on the Continue button. On the summary page, you can enter a discount code if you have one and choose the payment method. Once you complete the summary page, the order will be generated, and you will be redirected to the payment gateway according to the chosen payment method.

**âœ” Great! Now you can proceed with the payment. If you have any questions about paying your invoices, you can check our tutorial [here](/payments-country).** Once we receive the payment, we will send you an email confirming the activation of your services and the access details to cPanel.
