    FiveM does not allow hosting providers to sell FiveM hosting, restricting only one server per IP. However, according to the terms of service it is possible to host FiveM on VPS of any provider, that is why VexyHost offers Windows VPS with the necessary tools already pre-installed, unfortunately we cannot offer it as Game Hosting with our game panel.

<Steps>

### Step 1 - Choose plan
Go to [FiveM plans](https://vexyhost.com/fivem/). Choose the plan that best suits your needs. If you're unsure which one to choose, you can contact support for assistance.

### Step 2 - Choose billing cycle
Next, you'll need to choose the billing cycle. You can choose to pay for your service monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. **The longer the period you choose, the more discount you'll receive.**

| Cycle | Months |
| ------ | ------ |
| Monthly | Every month |
| Quarterly | Every 3 months |
| Semi-Annual | Every 6 months |
| Annual | Every 12 months |

### Step 3 - Server Location
In the "Location" section, you can choose the location of your server. Most of the time, the displayed locations have available stock. However, it's possible that a location may not have stock at that moment, and your server will be created in a nearby location.

### Step 4 - Backups
In the "Backups" section, we offer the possibility to access backups for free. You can create backups and restore them up to 10 times per month for each backup action.

<Callout type="info">
These backups cannot be downloaded since they are KVM virtualization images.

    Plans offer additional services such as "Server migration," where we handle migrating your server from another hosting provider to ours. If you choose this add-on, you should open a support ticket after the purchase.

### Step 6 - Review & Payment
ðŸ‘€ Review the summary of your purchase and click on the Continue button. On the summary page, you can enter a discount code if you have one and choose the payment method. Once you complete the summary page, the order will be generated, and you will be redirected to the payment gateway according to the chosen payment method.

</Steps>

**âœ” Great! Now you can proceed with the payment. If you have any questions about paying your invoices, you can check our tutorial [here](/payments-country).** Once we receive the payment, we will send you an email confirming the activation of your services and the access details to the VPS.
