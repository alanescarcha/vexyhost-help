```

This error indicates that the GM is not being able to connect to the database, check that the resource in the **"sql "** folder is configured correctly.
To configure the **"sql"** resource you must go to the File manager, go to the `mods > deathmatch > resources > sql` folder and edit the `mysql.lua` file:

```lua filename="/mods/deathmatch/resources/sql/mysql.lua"
	local server = "127.0.0.1"
	local user = "USUARIO_DB"
	local password = "CLAVE_DB"
	local db = "NOMBRE_DB"
	local port = 3306
	local socket = "/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock"
```

Make sure that the data in the mysql.lua file is correct. In the example above you would have to change the server, user, password and db.

<Callout type="warning">
The port is always **3306** and the socket is always **"/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock"**. If you need to create a database for your GM click [here](/game-panel/databases)

## MySQL module missing
This error in the console looks like this:
```go {3,6,9}
[04:13:55] Server stopped!

[04:13:55] Server shutdown as requested by resource sql (MySQL module missing.)

[04:13:55] Server shutdown as requested by resource sql (MySQL module missing.)

[04:13:55] Server shutdown as requested by resource sql (MySQL module missing.)
[04:13:55] Start up of resource sql cancelled by script
[04:13:55] Start up of resource vehicles cancelled by script
[04:13:55] Closing SQLite3 database
```

The error indicates that GM cannot find the `mta_mysql.so` module. This module must be in the `x64 > modules` folder, if you only have a module named `mta_mysql.dll` it will not work because the .dll files are for Windows. In VexyHost all MTA:SA servers run on Linux, so you will need the module in .so format.

You can download the module from the official MTA wiki: https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/Modules/MTA-MySQL

In case you have the correct module and it still does not load, it is possible that it is not configured in the `mtaserver.conf` file. To tell the server to load the `mta_mysql.so` module it must be configured as follows:

```html filename="/mods/deathmatch/mtaserver.conf" {3}
    <!-- Specifies the module(s) which are loaded with the server. To load several modules, add more <module>
         parameter(s). Optional parameter. -->
    <module src="mta_mysql.so"/>
```

Placing `<module src="mta_mysql.so"/>` in the `mtaserver.conf` file should fix the problem eventually. If not, open a support ticket so we can help you.
